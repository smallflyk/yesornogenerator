This is a replica of the "Yes or No Wheel" tool found at [pickerwheel.com](https://pickerwheel.com/tools/yes-or-no-wheel/). It's a simple web application that helps users make decisions by randomly generating "Yes" or "No" answers.

## Features

- Two modes: "Yes or No" and "Yes, No, or Maybe"
- Customizable number of input sets
- Spinning wheel animation
- Result tracking with counters
- Full-screen mode
- Mobile-responsive design

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Choose a mode (Yes/No or Yes/No/Maybe)
3. Set the number of input sets (1-5)
4. Click the "SPIN" button or press Ctrl+Enter to spin the wheel
5. The result will be displayed and counted
